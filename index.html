          <p>Running is the king of cardio. Running even five to 10 minutes a day, at slow speeds (how does a nice
            12-minute
            mile sound to you?) is associated with a drastically reduced risk of dying from cardiovascular disease,

          <p>Eating salads after dinner, will prevent your body from getting more calories. If the food you are trying
            to
            eat
            after dinner is unhealthy, they can also trigger more calories in your body. Hence, if you practise this
            regularly,
            your body would be habituated to this possibly best habit. So, sticking to the salad after dinner is the
            best
            thing
            for maintaining our health.</p>

            efficient
            way. Many people raved about the cheesecake and the soup and main were also very highly praised. The
            children’s
            meals went down well and the parents were very appreciative, while the vegetarian was particularly grateful
            for
            not being presented with yet another salad, as was the vegan! Our guest who had the melon was also very

            extremely
            special and I have never heard so many compliments about the food as I did on the day. Our food was lovely
            and
            although I couldn’t finish it all (my waistcoat was a big snug) I loved every mouth ful Our guests were
            over
            the
            moon with all the food, including the hog roast and as expected the dessert was amazing. I even heard the
            words
